    Get involved and help fix Ubuntu bugs! Obtain a list of bugs for an
    Ubuntu team or package that were created or updated yesterday.

    the number of bugs found, the output type to allow machine readable
    output, or set the behavior to open the bugs in a browser and
    immediately begin bug triage.
